# FINAL STEP

## 1. Discussion

We faced many challenges related to the ArCo knowledge Graph and the LLMs. However, the most significant ones were:
* The knowledge graph is still lacking some important information, making the research more difficult. E.g.: lack of IRI for San Giovanni Battista as agent and lack of property to express the relationship between the church and the saint to whom it is dedicated.
  * Solution: we took the DBpedia IRI of San Giovanni Battista and we added it to ArCo. Then we used a SPARQL CONSTRUCT query to create a new property and as a consequence we obtained a new triple.

* The LLMsâ€™ answers were not satisfactory since they did not provide us with accurate information. E.g.: they invented the IRIs instead of giving the actual ones.
  * Solution: we replaced the wrong IRIs with the correct ones and then created the new triple.

## 2. Conclusions 

* Previous analysis of the entities thanks to SPARQL queries
* Browsing the main ArCo ontologies to find classes and properties.
* Creation of new triples with SPARQL CONSTRUCT and LLMs to fill in knowledge gaps
* Using LLMs to retrieve useful information
* Enrichment of existing data
