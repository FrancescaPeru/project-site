# **OUR PROJECT**

### Abstract
This work presents an exploration of ArCo, the knowledge graph of the Italian Cultural Heritage, focusing on two religious monuments in Bologna: the _Basilica di Santo Stefano_ and the _Basilica di Santa Maria dei Servi_. The project aims to investigate how the ArCo ontology can be used to identify and describe these cultural properties and to detect potential gaps in ArCo.
Through this study, we enriched the existing knowledge graph by integrating additional descriptive details related to both basilicas. Furthermore, we employed Large Language Models (LLMs), including Gemini, ChatGPT, and Mistral, to retrieve contextual information, generate new triples and write SPARQL queries.
