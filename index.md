# INTRODUCTION


## Topic

Basilicas in Bologna: a detailed analysis of the Basilicas of _Santo Stefano_ and _Santa Maria dei Servi_.

When approaching this project, we started with something that we know and experience every day: the city of Bologna. We thought about which monuments we encounter daily and then we were curious to see if any of them were present in the knowledge graph. Browsing ArCo, we noticed that some information was missing and that is why we chose this topic for our project. 

### _Basilica di Santo Stefano_
Also known as _Sette Chiese_ (Seven Churches), the Basilica of _Santo Stefano_ is one of the oldest and most fascinating religious complexes in Bologna. It consists of several interconnected churches and chapels, built between the 5th and 13th centuries.

### _Basilica di Santa Maria dei Servi_
The Basilica of _Santa Maria dei Servi_ is a beautiful example of Gothic architecture in Bologna, built between the 14th and 15th centuries. It is known for its spacious, elegant interior and the striking colonnaded portico that surrounds its square. The basilica houses important works of art, including paintings, sculptures, and a notable organ. 

## Purpose

* Explore the ArCo knowledge graph to find the two cultural properties
* Detect potential gaps in their RDF descriptions
* Retrieve useful information using LLMs
* Produce new knowledge to enrich ArCo with further details

# **OUR PROJECT**

### Abstract
This work presents an exploration of ArCo, the knowledge graph of the Italian Cultural Heritage, focusing on two religious monuments in Bologna: the _Basilica di Santo Stefano_ and the _Basilica di Santa Maria dei Servi_. The project aims to investigate how the ArCo ontology can be used to identify and describe these cultural properties and to detect potential gaps in ArCo.
Through this study, we enriched the existing knowledge graph by integrating additional descriptive details related to both basilicas. Furthermore, we employed Large Language Models (LLMs), including Gemini, ChatGPT, and Mistral, to retrieve contextual information, generate new triples and write SPARQL queries.
